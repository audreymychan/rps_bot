> Rock Paper Scissor game app against a clever bot based on markov chains

**rps_bot** is a Flask-powered web game application which allows users to play against a robot trained using markov chains. It takes input from a user's choice (rock, paper, or scissor) and returns the robot's choice (without peeking into the future at the user's choice for that particular round).

## Future Work
- Publish the game app online
- Collect and keep historical data on how human's play the game
- Improve the markov chain model
- (nice to have) Improve UX/UI of the application
